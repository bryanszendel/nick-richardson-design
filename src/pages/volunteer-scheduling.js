After iterating as far as we felt we could without the user being able to experience something that felt more realistic, we had our devs build a working prototype that did just about everything except save to the database. This allowed us to confirm our hypothesis for only about $20,000 instead of $300,000. In addition, the work that was done on the prototype was also entirely recyclable for the real build.`}
